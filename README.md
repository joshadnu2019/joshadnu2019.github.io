April 2021 Look

The Cat above is our pet. He is known as "Mingming." He is 2 years old. His Birthday is September 2019 (unknown day).

LOCAL NAME: PUSA

COMMON NAME: PUSPIN CAT 

SCIENTIFIC NAME: Felis catus


A puspin cat or also known as “Pusang Pinoy” is a species that has no specific breed but they have a combination of coat colors that make them a domestic shorthair cat. Its weight would be from 8-10 inches depending on its growth per year, and its lifespan would be from 12-16 years. The cat on the left is a male cat, soon its weight would range to 15 lbs. that would help him to live for a longer time. It has odd-colored eyes, it may be blue or anything that is odd colored. Its tail would be of normal length or shortened but it would refer to as a “stumpy” tail.
	
This kind of cat can help people who are experiencing anxiety and depression, it will let them comfort in their problems. A puspin cat is affectionate, playful, quiet, calm, or also a mice hunter, so be cautious of its playful skills that might bite you. So take care of puspin cats to let them live longer.

Fun Fact:

Last November 2019, my mom wants a Cat to live in our house and she finds a house in Queborac, Naga City with lots of cats and she was interested to get. She was about to be given 3 cats, but she only get 2, the white and gray cat. The gray cat was his brother, the gray cat was scared of us and he left our house and never came back. I feel good that our white cat stayed with us until now, a very loyal pet!

We don't let him go inside our living room, kitchen, and areas inside our house (because my grandparents don't want for our safety from allergies, cat bite, etc.), but we let him stay in our garden, laundry area, and outer areas of our house and we let him go outside and bond anywhere.

Before, we let him eat cat feeds (he was still a kitten), but when the pandemic started, we don't feed him cat feeds anymore. We feed him cat food from our left overs.

Whenever he sees his master (my mom), he is importunate, he meows and energized because my mom feeds him food. But if he sees me, he meows a bit but does not importunate and sometimes he's scared of me while catching him. Haysst, haha. 😁😂 But I still love that cat so much. 😍
