The Cat above is our pet. He is known as "Mingming." He is 2 years old. His Birthday is September 2019 (unknown day).

LOCAL NAME: PUSA
COMMON NAME: PUSPIN CAT 
SCIENTIFIC NAME: Felis catus

	A puspin cat or also known as “Pusang Pinoy” is a species that has no specific breed but they have a combination of coat colors that make them a domestic shorthair cat. Its weight would be from 8-10 inches depending on its growth per year, and its lifespan would be from 12-16 years. The cat on the left is a male cat, soon its weight would range to 15 lbs. that would help him to live for a longer time. It has odd-colored eyes, it may be blue or anything that is odd colored. Its tail would be of normal length or shortened but it would refer to as a “stumpy” tail.

	This kind of cat can help people who are experiencing anxiety and depression, it will let them comfort in their problems. A puspin cat is affectionate, playful, quiet, calm, or also a mice hunter, so be cautious of its playful skills that might bite you. So take care of puspin cats to let them live longer.
